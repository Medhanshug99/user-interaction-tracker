#  User Interaction Tracker  

**Live Demo:** (https://user-interaction-tracker-1.vercel.app/)

##  Overview
The **User Interaction Tracker** is a browser-based simulator that demonstrates how everyday user actions contribute to a digital footprint. It tracks common interactions such as clicks, keystrokes, hovers, and session duration, and visualizes them in real time.

This project focuses on **client-side event tracking**, **data aggregation**, and **privacy awareness**, highlighting how even simple interactions generate behavioral data.

##  Why This Project Matters
- Most users are unaware of how much data is generated through normal browsing
- Demonstrates real-world analytics concepts used in production systems
- Emphasizes **ethical and transparent tracking**, not data misuse

---

##  Features
-  Tracks button clicks  
-  Counts keystrokes (without storing typed content)  
-  Detects hover interactions  
-  Measures time spent on the page  
-  Displays real-time aggregated metrics  
-  Logs user activity with timestamps  

---

##  Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Event Tracking** – Monitoring user-triggered browser events  
- **Data Aggregation** – Converting raw events into meaningful metrics  
- **Session Analytics** – Understanding user engagement duration  
- **Ethical Tech Awareness** – Tracking interaction metadata only, not personal data
