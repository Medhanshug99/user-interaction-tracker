# 🕵️ User Interaction Tracker  
*A Digital Footprint Simulator*

**Live Demo:** (https://user-interaction-tracker-js.vercel.app/)

## 📌 Overview
The **User Interaction Tracker** is a browser-based simulator that demonstrates how everyday user actions contribute to a digital footprint. It tracks common interactions such as clicks, keystrokes, hovers, and session duration, and visualizes them in real time.

This project focuses on **client-side event tracking**, **data aggregation**, and **privacy awareness**, highlighting how even simple interactions generate behavioral data.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
- Most users are unaware of how much data is generated through normal browsing
- Demonstrates real-world analytics concepts used in production systems
- Emphasizes **ethical and transparent tracking**, not data misuse

---
